# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
In this project, I am building Calories Burnt Prediction using python machine learning. Here, I have used XGBoost Regressor for model training. The dataset used in the project is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos).Here we have two csv file and we need to work in both the dataset.Overall process involve in this project are:
1. Data collection 
2. Data preprocessing
3. Data analysis
4. Train test split
5. Model training
6. Model Evalution
7. Building predictive model.
